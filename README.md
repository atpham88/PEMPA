# Model Overview
DCOPF model of the PJM power system, designed to explore state/federal policy interactions within large-scale wholesale electricity markets annually from 2016 to 2030. The model has full coverage of all existing generation units, calibrated to match year 2016 and Allows new NGCC,  wind, and solar capacity expansion starting in 2017.
Has five load zones agregated from over 20 load zones in PJM, but units and policies can be modelled at system, state, or state-approximate level. Links based upon transmission lines observed  between  zones.
Considers 96 load segments  for each load zone  (24 per season), to capture temporal variation in demand.  Demand  is elastic (-0.05).
Model is validated using 2018 data across several dimensions: generation mix, CO2 emission by zones, predicted new capacity, and zonal LMPs.
